We consider the inflating Universe to consist of two condensates. One inflaton condensate with $N_\phi$ inflatons, and one graviton condensate with $N$ gravitons. The number of inflatons is given by:
\begin{equation}
   N_\phi = n_\phi R_H^3 = \frac{n_\phi}{H^3}
\end{equation}
and the number of gravitons by:
\begin{equation}
	N = R_H^2 = \frac{1}{H^2}
\end{equation}

The main quantum effect taking place for the bulk of inflations is the quantum depletion of the condensates. As inflatons vastly dominate gravitons, and the inflaton self quantum scattering is negligible, the main contribution to this comes from inflaton-graviton scattering as given by:
\begin{equation}
   \dot{N}_\phi^{\rm dep} = \dot{N}_{\rm dep} = - \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}\frac{N_{\phi}}{N}
\end{equation}

Below we will work out the actual results of these equations for different types of potentials for single field inflation.
