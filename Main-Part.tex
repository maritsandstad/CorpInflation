We consider the inflating Universe to consist of two condensates. One inflaton condensate with $N_\phi$ inflatons, and one graviton condensate with $N$ gravitons. The number of inflatons is given by:
\begin{equation}
	N_\phi = n_\phi R_H^3
\end{equation}
and the number of gravitons by:
\begin{equation}
	N = R_H^2 = \frac{1}{H^2}
\end{equation}
